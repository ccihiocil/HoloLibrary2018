# Compare Books

This example shows Book Info taken from Google Books. The provided link is with the API key.
For multiple books just instantiate the Book_UI window (the code will automatically apply to a new Book/new JSON object)

How to "physically" compare books in a reasonable small scenario: use Fussion effect with multiple targets
I excluded this, because I founded it extreamly impractical, especially when comparison is possible with AR UI windows.
